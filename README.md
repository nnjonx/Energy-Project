# Energy-Project
(This was a final project I created in my CS 349 class)

This is a program for a user to enter a customer's information to be stored (this program can be further improved to include a database to be used alongside with it to store even more data as I demonstrated that the program
could connect to a database). 

The user can create, update, delete, and view the data. They then can access a database that has the customer's meter readings, payments, bills, and tariff details. 
The user can also create an invoice for the customer.
The rar file contains the java code of the program and a connection example to a potential database. Feel free to ignore the connection file if you're not interested
in connecting the program to a database (the code is not coded to be compatible with a database but it is possible to make it compatible)

Below are some images of the program's functions.
