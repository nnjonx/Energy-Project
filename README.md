# Energy-Project
(This was a final project I created in my CS 349 class)

This is a program for a user to enter a customer's information to be stored (this program can be further improved to include a database to be used alongside with it to store even more data as I demonstrated that the program
could connect to a database). 

The user can create, update, delete, and view the data. They then can access a database that has the customer's meter readings, payments, bills, and tariff details. 
The user can also create an invoice for the customer.
